By: Joshua Harris

Assignment 0 (C)- Introductory MP, shared C code of a Map-Reduce implementation done in the previous
class CS 241.

Assignment 1.0 - 1.2 (Java)- These Assignments were centered around a Maze Solving Library.
Incorporated Test  Driven Development, OO Design principles, and more. They Code used the A* 
algorithm to solve mazes and allowed multiple choices in heuristics.

Assignment 2.0 - 2.1 (Python) - These Assignments involved Parsing a JSON formatted file and
creating a fake Network for an Airline. It could calulate fact about the airport as well as query
the network for the user. There were many other useful features, I did not get to implement the find
shortest route method with Djistra's algorithm.

Assignment 3.0 - 3.2 (PHP/HTML/CSS) - This assignment centered around making a web portfolio for the
various assignments worked on throughout the semester. It used the logs from SVN to display relevant
information to the viewers.
